## Build tools & versions used
Xcode 14.1

## Steps to run the app
Open the project file in xcode, run using command + R.

## What areas of the app did you focus on?
I focused on organization and readability.
I did my best to comment all of my code to make the use of each element clear.
Additionally, I organized the services, data models, view models, views, errors, and tests seperately to make the project more navigatable.

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
I believe organization and readability are the most important elements you can add in a project to ensure that your coworkers can effectively review and extend your code. This is why I chose to focus on these factors most intently when working on the project. I would hope that readers can easily see the intention of each element and how the various parts fit together seamlessly to create the directory.

## How long did you spend on this project?
I spent about 6 hours give or take.

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
I didn't have much time left to work on image caching. I had never worked on caching before, this was a first. I would hope to implement a solid image caching solution that is effective in saving network bandwidth. With more time I could write this with inspiration from an open source library.

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
As I mentioned above, the image caching was implemented with the most haste and could use the most improvement.
